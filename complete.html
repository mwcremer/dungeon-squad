<p>Complete Dungeon Squad is a role-playing game designed expressly for players with short attention spans who demand action and fun. There is a lot of die rolling and some amusing shopping and number-crunching. Characters can be generated in a very short time.</p>

<p>Complete Dungeon Squad is a spin off of Jason Morningstar&rsquo;s original <em>Dungeon Squad</em> and other derivative works on http://www.1km1kt.net and is provided under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 Creative Commons license.</p>

<h3>WHAT YOU NEED</h3>

<p>Each participant should have access to a pencil, paper, and a set of polyhedral dice - one of each, from D4 up to D20.</p>

<p><em>Special Dice:</em> Sometimes magic items or other similar things will boost or reduce the value of a die. A D4 reduces to a D2. A d2 reduces to D0 (Die Zero - No chance / No roll.) A D12 can not be increased by training (D12 is the highest score allowed on a character sheet) but magic items that boost a D12 by a die type can still increase it to the next level or higher, a special roll called a D14 (or more).</p>

<p>D2 (Roll any die. Odd = 1, Even = 2)<br/>
D14 (D12+D2)<br/>
D16 (D12+D4)<br/>
D18 (D12+D6)</p>

<p><em>Face value:</em> this represents the maximum possible score of a dice (i.e.: for a six sided dice 6 is the Face value).</p>

<p><em>Average value:</em> One half the Face value (i.e.: for a six sided dice 3 is the Average value).</p>

<h3>CHARACTER GENERATION</h3>

<p>Each character has 15 Character points (CP) to buy Aspects, Spells, Pacts, Talents and Equipment. There are three aspects - Wizard, Warrior and Explorer. Aspect dice have the following costs:</p>

<p><em>* reserved for creatures not of this world</em></p>

<p>Spells have a Strength rated exactly like Aspects and costing exactly the same amount of CP.
Minor Pacts cost 1 CP, Major Pacts cost 2 CP.</p>

<p>Talents cost 1 CP each, they grant a fixed +1 bonus to any action roll related to its field of expertise, a Talent may be bought twice for a +2 bonus (see below for an explanation of Talents).</p>

<p>A character can change 1 CP to 10 Gold pieces so to but equipment: hit point or aspect improvements can&rsquo;t be bought at game start.</p>

<p>Everyone has 5 Hit Points plus the Face Value of the Warrior die. Damage reduces these directly. At 0 the character is unconscious at -1 or less it is dead. Characters heal naturally at a rate of D2 per day.</p>

<p>Everyone has 5 Magic Points plus the Face Value of the Wizard die. Spell casting reduces MP by a spell&rsquo;s cost. Characters recover lost MP&rsquo;s at a rate of D4 per full hour of meditation or for a full night&rsquo;s rest.</p>

<p>No character can carry more items then its Explorer Dice Face Value.</p>

<p>All Characters start play with 0 Advancement points and a Notoriety of Adventurer (rated at D6).</p>

<blockquote><p>Example: I want to make a wizardly-thief type character, so I choose Wizard D10, Explorer D8, and Warrior D4. My wizardly thief has 9 hit Points, 15 MP and a Carrying capacity of 8. Let&rsquo;s hope I have someone along to keep me out of harm&rsquo;s way in a fight! For my roguish wizard, I choose the spells Darkness at D6 and Lightning at D6 and save my last 3 CPs for 15 GP of equipment. My character&rsquo;s starting Notoriety is Adventurer (D6), I&rsquo;m not taking any Talents.</p></blockquote>

<h3>RESOLUTION MECHANIC</h3>

<p>Game play is divided in rounds (usually representing a handful of seconds), at the beginning of the round have all characters declare their actions, then each one rolls its Initiative dice depending on the armor it is wearing (see Armor).</p>

<p>Actions are resolved in descending order of initiative, tied rolls result in contemporary actions.
A character can also move a number of squares equal to its initiative roll, twice that much if doing nothing else.</p>

<p>Large creatures move twice as fast, while Small ones move at half speed.
Characters can pass their turn and act at a later time in the round, multiple interruptions are resolved in order of original initiative.
At any time, a character that has not already acted can change its mind and Counter (see below) another character&rsquo;s action.</p>

<p>All characters can fight, cast spells, and sneak around at varying levels of skill. Difficulty is reflected by a target number, typically 2, 4, or 6.</p>

<p>Roll against Warrior to hit in combat. If the target is Small your attack suffers a -1 die step to the attack roll, if the target is Large you receive a +1 die step to the attack roll. You hit the target if you roll at least as high as the Target&rsquo;s Average Warrior value.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you assign D4 to Warrior, direct combat will prove a challenge, if not impossible.</p>

<p>Roll against Wizard to cast a spell, remember scholarly things or to understand cryptic languages and items. A 6 or better is needed to cast a spell successfully, or a 2 or better if the caster is not in a dangerous situation. Casting spells from a charged enchanted item or learning the powers of any enchanted item once identified as magical requires a roll of 4. One peaceful option would be to assign D4 to Wizard and take &ldquo;Healing&rdquo; as a spell, casting it only between battles.</p>

<p>Roll against Explorer to sneak around, survive in the outdoors, performing acrobatics and be a thief. You need a 2 or better to move silently, a 4 or better to pick a lock or climb a wall, and a 6 or better to disarm a trap or jump a chasm.</p>

<p>Roll against Notoriety to convince, bribe or impress people. You need a 2 or better to tell a small lie or convince a friend, a 4 or better to befriend strangers and enlist henchmen, and a 6 or better to make a consistent public speech or read poetry.</p>

<p>Roll against Initiative for tests of speed and races or to avoid falling boulders which usually requires a 4 or more.</p>

<p>Difficulties of 8, 10, or even more are reserved for truly epic tasks, anyway the GM may state that a task is impossible and will fail no matter what.</p>

<p>At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, difficulty maybe set at one half of a specific Aspect&rsquo;s Face value.
Some expensive (and usually magical) gear affords a +1 bonus to a specific activity, effectively bumping the die up one rank. Your D4 Explorer becomes D6, for example, when sneaking in Elven boots.</p>

<h3>SPECIAL RESULTS</h3>

<p>If the result rolled is twice the Difficulty number a spectacular success takes place: usually twice damage or twice a spell effect&hellip; conversely if the result rolled is under one-half the Difficulty number a spectacular failure takes place: you might lose next round, drop your weapon or hit the wrong person with your spell (or lose as many MP or HP equal to the effect dice with no spell actually taking place&hellip;). Spectacular results are handled at a GM&rsquo;s whim.</p>

<h3>COUNTERING &amp; CONTESTS</h3>

<p>A character may receive resistance by an opponent while resolving an action (wizards may encounter people that try to resist their spells, enemies may evade attacks and cautious people may be on watch for sneaking thieves&hellip;).</p>

<p>Resisting character lose their action trying to resist the &ldquo;attacker&rsquo;s&rdquo; action: after the GM has determined the task&rsquo;s difficulty the resisting character gets to roll his own dice (roll the same dice the &ldquo;attacking&rdquo; character would), the attacker must now beat the higher result between the base difficulty and the resisting character&rsquo;s die roll.</p>

<p>At other times, two or more characters may try to achieve the same thing (be it winning a game of chess or an archery prize), have each of the partecipants roll its aspect dice: the character attaining the highest result wins the contest.</p>

<h3>TALENTS</h3>

<p>Talents represent areas of specialization in one of the many facets that make up an Aspect: talents are rather self-explanatroy, brief and narrow in scope: &ldquo;swordmastery&rdquo; is clearly a Warrior Talent, while &ldquo;Combat&rdquo; could never be accepted as a Talent by a GM.</p>

<p>Whenever a character engages in an activity covered by one of his Talents, it adds the Talent&rsquo;s Rank (1 or 2) to the dice roll: If my example character above (we shall call him the &lsquo;White Mouser&rsquo;) had taken &ldquo;Fencing 1&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d add 1 to all his warrior rolls when he uses a sword.</p>

<p>Some Talents may apply to more then Aspect, like &lsquo;Appraisal&rsquo; depending on what is being evaluated for cash money: Warrior would be used to appraise a sword, while Explorere to appraise a horse or Wizard for an ancient book but the character would get its Talent bonus on the roll regardless of the Aspect involved.</p>

<p>Other Talents, like &ldquo;Public Speaking&rdquo;, affect Notoriety or might affect Initiative (Alertness) while Physician would affect all healing rolls (either by bandaging, application of salves or natural healing) that is administered or controlled by the Physiscian character.</p>

<p>In the end, the GM is the only judge on what rolls receive a Talent bonus: in no case should they be applied to effect rolls like spells and damage rolls! Increased Aspect rolls already provide characters with an increased chance of achieving spectacular success and thus increasing effect rolls.</p>

<p>Here follows a list of applicable Talents and &ndash;typically&ndash; related Aspect:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acrobatics (Explorer)</li>
<li>Alertness (Initiative)</li>
<li>Archery (Warrior)</li>
<li>Beast taming (Explorer)</li>
<li>Climbing (Explorer)</li>

<li>Physician (healing rolls)</li>
<li>Pick pockets (Explorer)</li>

<li>Survival (Explorer)</li>
<li>Swimming (Explorer)</li>
<li>Trapmaking (Explorer)</li>
</ul>


<h3>THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ADVENTURERS</h3>

<p>Falling and asphyxia are two examples of bad things a character can be exposed to&hellip; as well as hunger or thirst.</p>

<p>A character takes damage from falling with a Face value equal to the meters fallen. If the fall is an odd measure use the lower nearest Face Value, falling damage ignores armor: so a character falling 20 meters takes D20 damage without the benefit of armor.</p>

<p>Asphyxia is caused by lack of breathable air (so non living creatures can be considered immune to it): asphyxia inflicts D2 damage per round regardless of armor or magic reductions.</p>

<p>Lack of food or water inflicts D4 damage per day regardless of armor or magic reductions, lack of both causes D8 damage per day.</p>

<p>Another example of annoying events that can tax your adventurers are extremes of cold or heat: inappropriately garbed heroes might suffer from D2 to D4 damage points per hour of exposure to the elements: a warm cloak might be enough to stop the cold in some cases, or reduce the worst of freezing temperatures, on the contrary wearing armor under a hot sun will probably cause more damage then good.</p>

<p>Last of all comes poison and drugs (and illness that works in a similar way): poison splashed on weapons affects enemies only after armor (if any) has been considered: if armor reduces weapon damage to zero, poison has no effect. Poison on a weapon will last for one combat only, a new dose must be used for another combat.</p>

<p>Poison can also cause damage if imbibed. No matter how poison gets administered, its effects last only three rounds: so after three rounds a poisoned wound damages no more, while an ingested poison will inflict its damage from three consecutive rounds unless stopped by an antidote or some healing spell. Drugs are poisons that are not meant to kill, use the description for the dazzle spell and use the poison dice as the effect roll.</p>

<p>Illness works as poison but change the time unit from rounds to days.</p>

<h3>EQUIPMENT AND THINGS THAT NEEDS TO BE ASSIGNED A &ldquo;STUFF&rdquo; DIE</h3>

<p>Weapons do their die in damage and are rated at D4, D8, or even D12, Magic weapons act at +1 Die step! A magical dagger inflicts D6 damage. Anyone can do D2 damage with their fists, if they have no better weapon.</p>

<p>Bows and other ranged weapons can damage a foe from a distance, doing their die in damage, each ranged weapon has its effective maximum range in squares:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the target is far away a number of squares up to the effective range the attack is a hit on 4 or more.</li>
<li>If the target is far away a number of squares up to twice the effective range the attack is a hit on 6 or more.</li>
<li>If the target is far away a number of squares more then twice the effective range the attack is a hit on 8 or more.</li>
<li>If the target is Small your attack suffers a -1 die step to the attack roll, if the target is Large you receive a +1 die step to the attack roll.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whips, firearms (musket and wheellock pistol) and crossbows follow special rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>a whip is treated as a ranged weapon a whip may trip: If hit, target must roll 4 or better Explorer check or fall down, loosing their next turn.</li>
<li>crossbows and firearms require one round to recharge, they can&rsquo;t be fired continuously.</li>
<li>firearms damage is reduced by Armor at one-half its strength: chain mail for example would reduce firearms damage only by 1 to 3 points.</li>
</ul>


<p>Armor reduces damage taken by a roll of its die. Thus, if you are hit for 7 points of damage and have armor, you can roll that die and reduce damage taken by that amount, possibly all the way to zero. Magic armor and shields act at +1 Die step! A magical chain stops D8 damage while simply reducing Wizard by 1 die step.</p>

<p>Off-Hand daggers can block D4 damage as armor. They do not grant wielders additional attacks but they can be thrown in a pinch and do their die in damage as a ranged weapon.</p>

<p>Shield bonuses listed above also include off-hand daggers. Wizards must keep their hands free for casting and so can not use shields or off-hand daggers (nor normal weapons) while casting spells.</p>

<p>Optionally, shields or second hand weapons can be used to increase attack damage in melee by one-die step instead of improving the Armor roll or to execute a second melee attack at -1 die step. This intention must be declared before rolling for Initiative and can be changed if a character later choses to Counter an attacker.</p>

<p><em>Initiative/Movement Die:</em> Roll this at the start of every turn. High roll goes first. You can move this many squares and still attack, or 2x this many squares and not attack at all.</p>

<h3>OTHER EQUIPMENT</h3>

<p>In the dungeon there may be treasures, such as magic swords (+1 die size to damage), magic wands (+1 die size for wizards casting spells), Elven boots (+1 die size for moving silently), and potions or scrolls (containing spells with a one-time use).</p>

<p>Gold pieces can also be found! Gold can be used to buy equipment, like ropes, lock-picks, lanterns, and ten-foot poles. Ropes, picks and shovels, and other equipment can be purchased, but has no &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; die associated with it.</p>

<p>No character can carry more items then its maximum Explorer Dice result.</p>

<p>Each of the following counts an item:
- Armor
- Shield
- Any weapon

</ul>


<p>Magic items, weapons and armor can be bought or sold at ten times the base item cost. Silver weapons cost twice as much. Scrolls, poisons and potions can be created in a wizards laboratory for half cost, however inscribing a spell scroll will require the usual expenditure of Magic Points for casting the spell.</p>

<h3>MAGIC</h3>

<p>A 6 or better is needed to cast a spell successfully in battle, or a 2 or better if the caster is not in a dangerous situation. Casting spells from enchanted items require a roll of 4 or better. Once the spell is successfully cast, roll the spell dice to determine effects. Magic requires mobility and freedom of speech: all magic has line of sight range. Spell casting reduces the magician&rsquo;s magic points by its COST, but only if the spell is successfully cast. Once a character&rsquo;s MP are reduced to 0, no spell may be cast till MP&rsquo;s are recovered. A magician can not cast a spell whose cost would reduce its MP to less then 0.</p>

<p>A casting magician is not forced to use the full effect dice result.</p>

<h3>SPELL LIST</h3>

<p><strong>CLAIRVOYANCE</strong> allows the wizard to see and hear anything that is happening regardless of barriers and distances. The effect works for a number of rounds equal to the effect roll and allows for pinpointing on specific items or events specified by the wizard, however applying the spell on things further then the horizon requires a focusing item like a watery expanse, a bonfire or an item intimately connected on what the wizard wants to see. COST 4</p>

<p><strong>COMMAND</strong> imparts orders to one NPC which must be obeyed for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled. Self destructive orders or orders against STRONG beliefs of the victim will break the spell if the target rolls Wizard at 4 or more. COST 2</p>

<p><strong>COMMUNE</strong> allows the wizard to ask the GM a number of yes-no questions equal to the Spell effect roll, the GM must answer truthfully COST 3</p>

<p><strong>DARKNESS</strong> creates an area of darkness for a number of rounds equal to its die roll. COST 1</p>

<p><strong>DAZZLE</strong> causes one man-sized enemy to hesitate for every 2 points rolled. Large creatures require 4 points; Small ones, 1! Victims cannot take any action for a turn when they are dazzled. COST 2</p>

<p><strong>DISPEL</strong> causes all Spells in effect within 10 squares to be interrupted if the wizards' Spell effect roll beats a targeted spells' effect roll. Will not affect enchanted items or familiars apart from dispelling their spells.
Dispel will however break summonings and necromancy. COST 4</p>

<p><strong>EAGLE&rsquo;S WINGS</strong> the sorcerer can fly like bird for a number of rounds equal to the successful spell roll with a Speed die equal to the Spell dice in any direction. He may cast spells, use missiles, attack as normal and may hover,speed up and slow down at will. COST 3</p>

<p><strong>ENCHANTMENT</strong> creates a magical item, either improving its user&rsquo;s dice or its own effect dice by +1 step permanently or allowing the item to cast a spell known to the enchanter at the enchanter&rsquo;s Spell dice, in this case the item can cast the spell a number of times equal to the effect dice roll before recharging is necessary.</p>

<p>Requires 1 day work in a wizards laboratory and an expense in Gold pieces equal to five times the item&rsquo;s cost.</p>

<p>COST 8 + spell to be imbued and permanent loss of either 1 die step from an Aspect, 1 MP or 1 HP if first enchantment, there is no permanent expense for recharging.</p>

<p><strong>ESP</strong> allows the wizard to read minds for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled, one mind may be read each round.COST 3.</p>

<p><strong>FAMILIAR</strong> summons an enchanted animal to serve the wizard welding the two life forces together. The familiar is bound forever to the wizard that can not dismiss it, a new familiar can only be summoned if an old one dies: death of a familiar is shocking and causes the permanent loss of either 1 die step from an Aspect, 1 MP or 1 HP.</p>

<p>A familiar is generated as a player character using as many CP as is the Face value of the spell, a wizard can not buy Gold and equipment with these points, only Spells Aspects and Talents. All familiars are automathically Small creatures: usually cats or owls, all familiars speak both human language and their animal.</p>

<p>No matter how far from each other a wizard and its familiar can:</p>

<ul>
<li>comunicate mentally</li>
<li>share their senses</li>
<li>share their Hit and Magic points</li>
<li>share their spells and Talents</li>
<li>the wizard can use the familiar as starting point from a spell</li>
<li>the wizard canaffect automatically the familiar with any spell he casts on himself</li>
</ul>


<p>COST 4 + permanent loss of either 1 MP or 1 HP. This spell requires also the sacrifice of materials worth 20 GP.</p>

<p><strong>FIREBALL</strong> does triple its die in damage! Roll the Fireball&rsquo;s die, then multiply the result by three. Anyone near the target takes the straight, pre-multiplication Fireball die in damage as well - a powerful spell! COST 4</p>

<p><strong>FORCEBUBBLE</strong> creates an impenetrable bubble of energy with a 3 squares radius that can not be broken in any way except a Dispel spell. The bubble lasts a number of rounds equal to the effect roll. COST 5</p>

<p><strong>HEALING</strong> restores its die in hit points to the person the wizard chooses. COST 2</p>

<p><strong>ILLUSION</strong> allows the creation of any kind of audio visual effects and happenings, all spectators will believe the illusion unless they attempt to disbelieve what they see or actually come in physical contact with the illusion: at this point roll the spell&rsquo;s effect Dice against the disbelieving target(s) Wizard Aspect. A succesfully disbelieved illusion will not disappear but will be recognized for what it is. Disbelief is not &ldquo;contagious&rdquo;: if a friendly character points out the illusory nature of an event, this will not cause the victim to automatically disbelieve it as well, yet allows for another attempt at disbelief.

<h3>Pacts</h3>

<p>Pacts are a special form of magic, they represent a Pact between a character and some Overworldy or Underworldy Force. The Pact-holder vows to defend and uphold everything that the Force stands for and strike down its enemies.</p>

<p>Followers of pacts tend to aggregate in temples, cloisters and monasteries.</p>

<p>Each character can hold only one Pact at a time and must abide by all its restrictions to gain the benefits of the Pact. Breeching the imposed restrictions has at least the effect of forbidding the character from using the Pacts power till he atones, major breeches may result in permanent loss of Pact benefits and being hunted down by all Pact holders of the same Force.</p>

<p>Each Pact is described by Prescriptions, Minor and Major Effects.</p>

<p>A character may abandon one pact to take another but loses all benefits and restrictions of the previous Pact.</p>

<h3>ADVANCEMENT</h3>

<p>Every time a monster is defeated all participants to its demise divide equally its Advancement value. A monster&rsquo;s Advancement value is calculated by adding to the Hit points of the creature any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Highest Aspect Face value</li>
<li>Ranged attack Face value</li>
<li>Armor Face value</li>
<li>Poison Face value</li>
<li>Strongest Spell Face value</li>
<li>5 points for each special ability not rated with a dice</li>
</ul>


<p>The GM should encourage good role-playing, clever playing and problem solving awarding players with 5 to 15 Advancement points depending on how well they did.</p>

<p>For every 100 advancement points Accumulated, the character gets to chose an Improvement, Improvements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase any die rated ability (Spell or Aspect) by one size, up to D12. Increasing Aspect dice does increase related scores like Hit points, Magic points or Carrying capacity.</li>
<li>Increase permanent hit point or magic point total by one, up to 24.</li>
<li>Learning a new Spell at D4</li>
<li>Learn a new Talent</li>
<li>Improve a Talent from Rk 1 to Rk 2</li>
<li>Take a Minor Pact</li>
<li>Improve a Pact from Minor to Major</li>
<li>Buy a Reroll</li>
</ul>


<p>No more then three re-rolls may be owned by a single character and no roll can be re-rolled more then once: however the character gets to keep the better result. Once a re-roll is used it will come back next game session.</p>

<p>To actually learn a new Spell or improve a known one a character must also spend 20 GP and have a wizard Laboratory available!</p>
